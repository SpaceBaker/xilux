# modules

Here is where you should put all your kernel modules source code.

For small, project specific module, it can be directly added here.  
However, it is highly suggested to wrap individual module into their own git repo.  
The philosophy is that each module is a project of it's own...  
Just clone it in here.

See 'hello-kernel' for a basic kernel module exemple.
