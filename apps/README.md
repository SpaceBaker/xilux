# apps

Here is where you should put all your userspace applications source code.

For small, project specific app, it can be directly added here.  
However, it is highly suggested to wrap individual app into their own git repo.  
The philosophy is that each app is a project of it's own...  
Just clone it in here.

See 'hello-userspace' for a basic userspace application exemple.
